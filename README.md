# About the project
Pose-emotion regression from a video is an emerging technology to identify and understand human emotions based on their body language and gestures. 
By analyzing the poses and movements (GAIT) of individuals captured in a video, this technology can infer their emotional states accurately.
By understanding usersâ€™ emotional states through their poses and gestures, systems and interfaces can be tailored to respond appropriately. 
Our work attempts to tackle this problem by means of a deep-learning architecture based on recurrent networks, specifically LSTM, to encode the poses of individuals extracted from the videos.
In addressing the problem, we frame it as a sequence-to-value regression task, mapping emotional states (happy, angry, sad, and neutral) to a 4-component vector. 
Two network architectures, EwalkNet and LandsAffectiveNet, are presented, each featuring a backbone encoder for landmarks and distinct affective features, results from experiments with these architectures are analyzed.

# How to use
0 - Create a directory named 'raw_video' (without apices) inside the 'data' directory. 

1 - In the 'raw_video' subdirectory, insert the videos related to validation.

2 - In the 'data' directory, insert the Excel containing the dataset related to users' responses to the videos, and refactor the name of this file as "labels.xlsx".

3 - In the main.py file specify the following path:
   - FEATURES_CSV: the name of the dataset containing the landmarks and the affective features extracted from the videos.
   - LABELS_XLSX: the name of the Excel file containing the dataset related to users' responses to the videos.
   - LABELS_CSV: the name of the CSV file containing the dataset related to users' responses to the videos preprocessed.

4 - Run the main.py to execute the pipeline, which consists of extracting features from the videos and saving them into a CSV, preprocessing the responses that constitute the labels for the regression task from the Excel file, and then providing them to the two main pre-trained architectures to plot the results."
